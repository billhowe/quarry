frontend contains a RESTful API and a canonical web app

backend contains an API for managing the quarry signature database.

All you need is backend if you will only access the quarry instance through python.

INSTALL

get python
get postgresql

follow brief instructions in deploy/README

edit backend/config.py to point to your database host

IF you want to harvest triples using the "harvester", you'll need to add scripts to 

./collectors/

and edit the rules in 

./rule

Given a filename, each collector should emit resource, property, value triples to stdout.

You can also just create files of triples manually.  

Then use backend/quarryLOAD.py to load the results.

See examples in the directory for more info.

Once some data is loaded, look at the examples at the 
bottom of frontend/quarry.py to see how to use python to query the triple store.
For a description of the API, see the paper
